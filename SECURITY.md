# TableauSocialExtension Security Policy

## LLM-Generated Security Report Policy

Absolutely no security reports will be accepted that have been generated by LLM
agents.

## Supported Versions

Security reports are accepted for the most recent major release with support for
the previous major version ending immediately.

TableauSocialExtension supports at most the three most recent versions of Elixir
and supported [Erlang/OTP versions][otp-versions].

As of December 2025, the support list is:

| Elixir | Erlang         |
| ------ | -------------- |
| 1.18   | 25, 26, 27, 28 |
| 1.19   | 26, 27, 28     |

The oldest supported version of Elixir will not be deprecated until six months
after the release of a new version of Elixir.
